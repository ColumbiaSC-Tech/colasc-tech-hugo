## Contributing

Start with `git clone --recursive`.

There are two submodules.
1) public/ - points to the actual location where github pages are rendered
2) themes/hugo-theme-nix/ - points to a fork currently of the chosen theme

Hugo is used to populate the public folder.

To verify changes locally:
`$ hugo serve`

To build and prepare for submission:
`$ hugo`
